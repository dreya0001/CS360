The Weight Tracker app was designed to address the user need for an effective way to monitor and manage weight loss or gain. It provides a user-friendly interface where individuals can log their daily weight, set personalized goals, and track their progress over time. The primary goal of the app is to motivate users by making it easy to see their weight fluctuations and progress toward their goals.

Screens and Features Supporting User Needs
To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, the app includes several key screens and features:

Login Screen: Allows users to securely access their accounts.
Main Dashboard: Displays the user's current weight, progress toward goals, and quick access to log new entries.
Weight Logging Screen: Enables users to input their daily weight with simple navigation.
Progress Tracking: Visual graphs illustrate weight trends over time, providing a clear representation of progress.
My UI designs focused on clarity and simplicity, ensuring that users can easily navigate and understand their data. For example, I used large buttons and clear labels to enhance usability, keeping in mind that a straightforward interface would facilitate user engagement and satisfaction. Feedback from user testing indicated that users appreciated the intuitive layout, contributing to the design's success.

Approach to Coding the App
I approached the coding process using an agile development strategy, allowing for iterative improvements based on continuous feedback. I began with setting up the project structure in Android Studio, followed by implementing core functionalities, such as user authentication and data logging. Techniques such as modular coding and version control helped manage the complexity of the app and enabled smooth collaboration.

In the future, I plan to apply these strategies by maintaining an agile mindset and utilizing modular designs for easier updates and scalability. This approach not only streamlines development but also enhances maintainability.

Testing for Functionality
To ensure my code was functional, I conducted both manual and automated testing. I utilized the Android Emulator to perform various scenarios, checking for bugs and ensuring all functionalities worked as expected. Additionally, I wrote unit tests for critical functions, which helped catch errors early in the development process.

This testing process is crucial because it reveals potential issues that might affect user experience. For instance, testing uncovered some UI responsiveness problems that I addressed before finalizing the app, ensuring a smooth user experience upon launch.

Innovation During the Development Process
Throughout the design and development process, I faced challenges, particularly in implementing the data storage and retrieval features effectively. I had to innovate by exploring different libraries and patterns for managing local data. Ultimately, I opted for a simple SQLite database, which provided the reliability and ease of use necessary for my app's requirements.

Demonstrating Knowledge, Skills, and Experience
I felt particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge of user-centered design principles in the app's UI development. By incorporating user feedback and iterating on design elements, I created an application that not only functions well but also resonates with users' needs and expectations. This experience has significantly enhanced my skills in both mobile app development and design thinking.

Conclusion
This reflection encapsulates my journey through the development of the Weight Tracker app, highlighting key insights and achievements. Submitting this artifact to my portfolio showcases my ability to develop a functional mobile app while applying best practices in design and user experience. I look forward to utilizing these skills in future projects and professional opportunities.
